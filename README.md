SkillNtrade
An application built with the sole purpose of connecting software developers like us with companies or peers.  Our application allows users to sign up, inform, and post needs/skills for either an attribute in the same field or monetary exchange.  Our application unlike others targets solely one field/industry.  The idea is to have a big community of coders that can showcase/assist/complement one another in bringing ideas to life.  Users are able to search based on their needs and location to better refine their search and needs.  
Our application has two differnt forms
-one where you can join our team/community 
-post your needs or what you are looking for 
Users are connected via email notification once they've found a skill they are looking for or post they are interested in assisting. 
We used sequelize, handlebars, express, body-parser, express-handlebars, moment and myql.
